  title: "Assisted Embryo Hatching",

  introduction:
    `Assisted embryo hatching is a <strong> specialized laboratory technique used in certain IVF treatments </strong>to support successful implantation of embryos in the uterus. Every embryo is surrounded by a protective outer shell called the <strong> zona pellucida </strong>, which must thin and break naturally for the embryo to attach to the uterine lining. \n
    In some cases, this hatching process may not occur efficiently, reducing the chances of implantation and successful pregnancy. <strong>Assisted embryo hatching creates a small opening or thins the zona pellucida </strong>, helping the embryo hatch naturally and attach to the uterine lining more effectively. This technique can be particularly beneficial in improving IVF success rates for specific patients.`,

  introduction:
   `Blastocyst transfer is an <strong> advanced step in the IVF process </strong> where embryos are cultured in the laboratory for <strong> five to six days after fertilization </strong> until they reach the blastocyst stage — a critical milestone in early embryo development.\n \n 
   Reaching this stage is highly significant, as only the <strong> healthiest and most viable embryos </strong>develop into blastocysts. Transferring embryos at this point not only mirrors the natural timing of conception, when an embryo enters the womb in a natural pregnancy, but also increases the chances of successful implantation and a healthy pregnancy.`,
